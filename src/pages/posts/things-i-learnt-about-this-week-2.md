* Numbering functions in BigQuery 

Numbering functions (‎RANK · ‎DENSE_RANK · ‎PERCENT_RANK · ‎CUME_DIST) in BigQuery can be used to answer the following questions:

* What are the top revenue-generating countries?
* How do I rank volleyball players per division and salary?
* What are the top N-performing countries by product category?
* What rows are duplicated based on an ingestion date?

* Shortcut to Type Backslash Symbol on Keyboard 

The shortcut to type the **Backslash Symbol** is **\[ALT] + 92** for Windows and **\[Option] + \[Shift] + \[7]** for Mac. To use the Windows shortcut, press down the **\[ALT]** key and type **92** using the numeric keypad. For Mac, simultaneously press and hold the ‘**Option’** and the ‘**Shift’** keys then hit once on the ‘7’ key.

* L﻿evel up your data analysis 

Data without context is still just “a number”.  You need context to get value and derive insights out of data.
