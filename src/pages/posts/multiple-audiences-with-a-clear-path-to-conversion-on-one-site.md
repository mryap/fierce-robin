A website that seeks to please everyone at once ends up serving no one at all. The last thing you want to do is create confusion for your valuable web visitors. 

How do you go about writing a "strong value proposition" that resonates with multiple audiences? For example, law firms practice many different areas of law. Higher education websites that need to reach out to undergraduate, post graduate and professional studies.

One technique I learn is write for different groups on the same page, but keep the page concise, driving each group to its own targeted landing page. 

Using recruitment agency website as an example, the homepage can have both of these
“Looking for an exciting, new career?” (for candidates), and
“Looking for the perfect candidate?” (for companies).

Your audience can then immediately identify which area they need to click to get to the right place.

Another is a split-test of a page that targets attract group 1 (control) against a page that targets both (treatment). This might clear things up and ensure you don't have to make a call without knowing it's the right one.

As long as you keep the different dynamics of your varied audiences in mind, you should be able to create an intuitive web design with a cohesive home page that appeals to a primary or universal audience base and specific landing pages that effectively meet the needs of distinct visitor groups. It about delivering a more relevant message to the relevant person.
