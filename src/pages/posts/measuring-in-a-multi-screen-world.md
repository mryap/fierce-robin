People are bringing mobile and tablet into the research and buying cycle. As a business owner, you need to understand what is really leading to the sales and how users are combining all these devices when they visit your online property.

Out of the box, Google Analytics allows you to identify unique users across browsing sessions, but it cannot identify unique users across different browsers or devices.

GA new User ID features allows you to assign a unique ID to these visits.  It allows you to more accurately identify a user across all the devices they use to access your site. From a visitors who might start off researching a product and services on Mobile/Tablet, checking reviews, making decisions and finally making the purchase from your website using the desktop computer.

This unique ID cannot have any PII (personally identifiable information), like an email/SSN/phone number. This User ID also allows you to go back 90 days of data on user activities.

The best way to implement GA new user ID feature is to have an authorization system like a login. If you are selling online, having a login allows you to give your prospect a place to save their favourite products they find on your website. This allows them to return your site, share with friends and family and continue where they stop whether is on a mobile/tablet or desktop computer. 

Google Analytics User ID features allows you to track the same visitors across different devices including desktop.  Setting Google Analytics user ID feature can be challenging. I am here to help. Just drop me a note.
