According to the speaker, Elaine Doyle

* 89% of traffic by 2022 will be video traffic. 
* Optimise video for those hot summer days with limited battery on mobile. 
* YouTube viewers want 3 things: Information — Connection — Entertainment.
* YouTube has 50% higher ad watch time than any other platform and is the second largest search engine in the world. 
* Irish people spend 45 minutes a day watching YouTube on mobile alone. For 18–24yr olds, that’s more time than on Netflix and TV players, combined. 
* 6 second bite-size ads are extremely effective to engage. 16–20 second “snack ads” are excellent to flesh out your story and finally another bite-size to echo your message.

The breakfast briefing also sharing the latest product updates, and useful resources to help inspire you to build your brand online.
