**Control your own positioning and narrative and not leave it up to customers to do for you.** Specific words, names, and category you use to define your products will trigger assumptions in the mind of your prospects.  Those assumptions are either going to make it really easy or really hard to close deals. So chose them purposefully, and don't mess them up!

What’s “obviously” awesome is not so obvious unless you know what to look for. And how to look for it. You need to be in customer context. Let’s say Salesforce launched a CRM in 2000.

There were many CRMs but the tech wasn’t popular. If you say next generation cloud automated CRM wont help. It would help ‘CRM that doesn’t need to be downloadable’ would help. Having space for such software was a pain.

Segment your audience to cover different uses of your product offering.

No matter what, you can and should always find a way to position yourself as the best choice.

Competitors and competitive alternatives are not the same thing. Need to consider the full spectrum of what your audience would do if you didn’t exist. Not just who you think you most directly compete with in your space. Great positioning gives customers a way to think about the entire market (not just you).

There are "consideration" and "retention" attributes and you should concentrate on the former.
