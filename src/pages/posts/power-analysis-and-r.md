Power analysis is one of the important aspects of experimental design. It allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence.

If the power of the test is too low, we ignore conclusions arrived from the data set.

In R, the following parameters required to calculate the power analysis

* Sample size
* Effect size
* Significance level
* Power of the test

If we have any of the three parameters given above, we can calculate the 4th one.
