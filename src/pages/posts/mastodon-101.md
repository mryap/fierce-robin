Moving to Mastodon? Make life easier for your followers. Post your new handle as a web link such as “[http://mastodon.social/@tjmcintyre](https://t.co/LJkocpWVwj)”, not “@tjmcintyre@mastodon.social” which displays as an email address.

If you want to import the people you follow on Twitter to your Mastodon acct (if they’re there), put your full ![](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f9a3.svg "🦣") address in your Twitter bio, go to [http://fedifinder.glitch.me](https://t.co/3SzqNpucHD), enter your Twitter login, and it will find them.
Export the file, go to ‘import’ in ![](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f9a3.svg "🦣") settings
Take time to consider where you want sign up; the .social community, where many start, is massive & may not give you much sense of local community you desire.
If you're in Ireland, consider joining Mastodon, there is an Irish 'instance' (community) at [http://Mastodon.ie](https://t.co/AoP6q832AU).
* UK > <https://mastodon.org.uk/about>
* SG > <https://kopiti.am/about>
 ~~You can move, and export and transfer your list of who you follow, but you cannot also move your followers, who will have to refollow.~~ .

You register a new account at the place you want to be, in settings there you can indicate an 'alias' (that it expects to be ported to). then in the old account, you can set it to migrate and it will see there is a willing recipient.

You can access everyone on Mastodon (regardless which instances they origin from) at <https://instances.social/> & <https://fediverse.party/> Does not have what you look for? With Mastodon, one can shelf hosted your own social media platform. 

There are no mysterious profit-based algorithms feeding and filtering posts, so you get a straightforward chronological feed of everything in your home community/instance.
