      ## Differences between AA and GA4


      Several months in a Digital Analyst role for the 2nd biggest Telco here. This Telco is using Adobe Analytics (AA).  Here my own take on what the difference between the ubiquitous Google Analytics and AA.


      In Google Analytics, essentially the data is available within the interface. You can get by and hit the road running. Think of GA as ready meal. You are able to customize the report with in a limited way.


      In Adobe Analytics, u start with a blank canvas. You pull the data using building blocks of dimensions, metrics and segments, assemble together that make sense to your  business. You can defined your own segments and metrics. Yes there is the official template but that won't do.


      Posted a question about Adobe Analytics and someone in the community turn it into a request feature for Adobe to consider.
