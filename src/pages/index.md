          I look at your entire marketing funnel – your whole platform, online
          and off-line – before and after people land on a website.


          They are part of your process, and they all feed into your bottom line.


          When we talk conversion, we are paying attention to your entire business so we don’t miss something important that could lead to huge boosts in income or devastating losses

          the A/B test is not due to coincidence. I minimize the chance that
          you’ll come to an unwise conclusion and help make important decisions
          in a risk-controlled manner.

      - question: What is Conversion
        answer: >-
          A desired action taking place on your customer touchpoint (i.e.
          website) — a click, or registration, or product action, for instance.


          A conversion occurs when a user completes an  action on your site that you consider to be valuable.  This can include a purchase, a file download, or a  request for additional information.
      - question: What is A/B Testing?
        answer: >-
          A/B testing is a way to test changes to your page against the current
          design and determine which ones produce positive results. 


          It is a method to validate that any new design or change to an element on your web pages or mobile apps is improving your conversion rate. 


          It is the assumption that you have never reached the ‘best’ version of your website, mobile app, or product, and that the best method of learning about your customers is through iterative testing and experimentation.
      - answer: >-
          Hypotheses are statements, not open-ended questions. They address a
          question with a proposed solution. 


          Crafting a hypothesis to address an open question or problem on your website enforces a well-rationalized, thoughtful proposal for how to address that problem.
